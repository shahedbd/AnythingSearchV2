## Description

**Anything Search** is a lightning-fast file search utility that instantly finds any file or folder on your computer. Unlike Windows built-in search, Anything Search indexes your entire system in under 2 minutes and delivers search results in milliseconds as you type.

Built with modern .NET 8.0 technology and optimized SQLite database, Anything Search can index over 1 million files while using minimal system resources. The clean, Windows 11-style interface makes finding your files effortless.

**Why Choose Anything Search?**

Tired of waiting for Windows Search to find your files? Anything Search creates a complete index of all your files and folders, enabling instant search results. Whether you're looking for a document you created months ago, a photo buried in nested folders, or a program file, Anything Search finds it instantly.

**Perfect For:**
• Professionals managing thousands of documents
• Developers searching through code repositories
• Photographers organizing large media libraries
• Students finding research papers and notes
• Anyone frustrated with slow Windows Search

**How It Works:**
1. Install and launch - automatic first-run indexing begins
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for initial index (runs in background)
3. Start typing - results appear instantly as you type
4. Double-click to open files or folders directly

Anything Search respects your privacy - all indexing is done locally on your device. No data is ever uploaded to external servers.
